## Scenario Questions

A time you succeeded / Your biggest accomplishments / Your greatest challenge - See TAG story above

A time you persuaded someone who did not agree with you - Talk about Leana and login functionality -- exaggerate if needed

A time you dealt with and resolved a conflict (among team members) - Matt's issues in labs

A time you led a team / a time you showed leadership skills - Second build week. Unit 3 dev was a no-show the whole week, ended up taking my other unit 2 devs and pushing to get the front end built (including looking ahead in the TK to connect to our back end, which would have been unit 3 dev's job).

A time you dealt with stress - First labs team, dumping the entire db and restarting our direction. Did 6 weeks of work in 2.5.

The most difficult problem you've encountered in your previous job, and how you solved it - At Magnext, inventory system was all over the place. Same items listed with different names, duplicate IDs everywhere. Made inventory management terrible, couldn't give correct info to salespeople or customers. Spent two weeks going through the warehouse manually taking inventory, then completely revamping the digital management system we used to make it accurate and easier to use.

A time you solved a problem creatively - Taking counts at movie theatre. Used whole team instead of just me.

A time you had to exceed expectations to get a job done - Hand-off for replacement at Magnext.

A time you showed initiative - Learned photoshop for Magnext to take on extra workload.

Tell me something thatâ€™s not on your resume - When working with TAG, hosted parties so staff members and community members could all meet each other.

An example of an important goal you set and how you reached it - Goal: Wanted to learn Node in first labs team. Leaned on Sean and asked lots of questions (thankfully he was nice enough to take me under his wing), reviewed the TK, ended up working 90% of the time on the Node side of the project.

A time you failed - At EIC, I improved site traffic by ~50% in 6 months, but owner wanted way more growth (visitors in the millions, we were at ~5000 a day). Ended up getting fired a few months later. Beat myself up for it. Never been fired before. Eventually I concluded that I worked hard and had done everything in my power to perform well, but sometimes the expectations make it hard to succeed. Still wish I had communicated my thoughts about the traffic goals more effectively, but I still believe I did good work even if it didn't meet the owner's expectations.
